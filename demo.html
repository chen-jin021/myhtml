<!-- Block and inline elements
A PARAGRAPH element is a block element
SPAN is an inline element which means it appears side by side-->



<!--Parents and Child Elements: 
<ul> & </ul> stands for the unordered list -> and is usually the parent
<li> & </li> stands for lists and is usually the children -->

<!-- you won't notice any difference if you omit the body tag, but once you start to write more sophisticated HTML documents, it will become much more important, so let's get into the habit now. -->

<!-- div & span 
the div ("division", as in a "division" or section of the page)
div is a block element
span (think, like some text that "spans" across a line).
span is a inline element-->

<!-- attributes: The syntax for defining an attribute is like so: in the opening tag, after the tag name, we type the name of the attribute, an equals sign, and a pair of double quotes containing the value of the attribute. 
You can have as many attributes as you want (each attribute is separated by a space). However, it's important that the tag name comes first. 
The id attribute can be used to distinguish the role that certain tags play. -->

<!-- Attribute for "achor" <a> tag AKA "hyperlink" 
Anchor tags need an attribute, called href, to be useful.
href is short for hyperlink reference
To cause links to open in a new browser tab, we combine href with another attribute called target.
Syntax: target="_blank", this tells your browser to open the link in a new tab! -->

<!-- images: src attribute 
1. img is self-closing. rather than having an opening and closing tag (<img></img>), the opening tag simply closes itself, like so: <img />.
The src attribute can be set to the URL of an image on the internet.
